# ZooKeeper Configuration File
# Essential settings for ZooKeeper ensemble operation

# Basic ZooKeeper Configuration
tickTime=2000
# [1] Fundamental time unit in milliseconds (heartbeat interval)
# [2] Used for session timeouts and minimum connection intervals
# [3] Default: 2000 (2 seconds)

dataDir=/home/hadoop/zookeeper/data
# [1] Directory where ZooKeeper stores its in-memory snapshots
# [2] Also contains transaction log files
# [3] Must match volume mount in docker-compose.yml

clientPort=2181
# [1] Port for client connections
# [2] Used by Hadoop components (NameNode, ResourceManager)
# [3] Must be exposed in container networking

# Cluster Coordination Parameters
initLimit=5
# [1] Timeout for followers to connect to leader (in ticks)
# [2] initLimit * tickTime = max initialization time (5*2000=10s)
# [3] Adjust higher for large clusters or slow networks

syncLimit=2
# [1] Timeout for follower sync with leader (in ticks)
# [2] syncLimit * tickTime = max sync time (2*2000=4s)
# [3] Controls how far followers can lag behind leader

# ZooKeeper Ensemble Configuration
server.1=Master1:2888:3888
# [1] Server 1 definition (myid=1 in dataDir/myid)
# [2] Format: server.X=hostname:peerPort:leaderElectionPort
# [3] 2888 - Follower communication port
# [4] 3888 - Leader election port

server.2=Master2:2888:3888
# Server 2 configuration (myid=2)
# Must match container hostname in docker-compose.yml

server.3=Master3:2888:3888
# Server 3 configuration (myid=3)
# Minimum 3 servers recommended for production quorum
